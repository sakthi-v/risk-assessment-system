The goal is to minimize the likelihood of a security incident occurring or to reduce its potential impact. This strategy is typically chosen when the current risk level is non-acceptable and effective controls can be identified and deployed.",
                "recommendation": "Choose 'Treat' when the residual risk is non-acceptable (above 2/5) and there are feasible, cost-effective controls that can reduce the risk to an acceptable level (1 or 2/5). This is highly recommended for the current Dell laptop security threats given the numerous high-severity control gaps and the 'Non-Acceptable' residual risk.",

It is typically chosen when the risk is already within acceptable criteria (1 or 2/5), or when the cost or effort of implementing additional controls outweighs the potential benefits, making treatment unfeasible due to financial, administrative, or technical reasons.",

                "description": "This strategy involves shifting the financial or operational impact of a risk to a third party, such as an insurer, vendor, or contractor, typically through contractual agreements or insurance policies. While the impact may be transferred, it is crucial to understand that the ultimate accountability for the risk often remains with the organization.",
                "recommendation": "Select 'Transfer' if the risk is non-acceptable (above 2/5) and a suitable third party can effectively manage or absorb the financial consequences, and a cost-benefit analysis supports this approach. This might be considered for specific aspects like cyber insurance for financial losses, but it does not replace the need for internal controls to reduce the likelihood of an incident.",
                "consequences": "Transferring the risk can reduce the organization's direct financial exposure to certain types of incidents. However, it incurs ongoing costs (premiums, service fees), introduces reliance on third-party performance, and may still leave residual risks that the organization must manage. Due diligence on the third party is critical, and accountability for the risk event itself often remains.",
                "estimated_cost": "Estimated cost: $500 - $5,000+ annually per device/user (e.g., cyber insurance premiums, managed security service fees, legal costs for contracts).",
                "typical_timeline": "1-3 months for negotiation, due diligence, and finalization of contracts or insurance policies.",
                "approval_required": "The Risk Owner (e.g., CIO/BU Head) is responsible for transferring the risk. For significant financial commitments or complex contractual agreements, higher-level management approval may be required, similar to the approval process for accepting non-acceptable risks.",
                "monitoring_required": "Ongoing monitoring of the third party's performance, adherence to contractual obligations, and regular review of insurance policy coverage or service level agreements. Periodic re-assessment of residual risks retained by the organization."

                "value": "TERMINATE",
                "label": "Terminate the Risk (Avoid Risk)",
                "description": "This option involves eliminating the risk entirely by ceasing the activity or process that gives rise to the risk. It is a drastic measure typically considered when a risk is non-acceptable, and it cannot be effectively treated or transferred, or the activity itself is deemed too hazardous to continue.",
                "recommendation": "Choose 'Terminate' if the security threats associated with the Dell laptop cannot be adequately managed through other means, and the business function or activity performed on the laptop is not critical or can be safely migrated/discontinued. This is a severe option and should only be considered if the asset's use case is inherently too risky.",
                "consequences": "Terminating the risk will completely remove the specific threat vector associated with the Dell laptop. However, it will result in the loss of the business function or capability provided by the laptop, potentially leading to lost productivity, revenue, or operational disruption. It may also incur costs associated with winding down the activity or finding alternative, potentially less efficient, solutions.",
                "estimated_cost": "Estimated cost: Highly variable, ranging from lost productivity/revenue (e.g., $1,000 - $10,000+ per month per user) to costs of decommissioning or finding alternative solutions.",
                "typical_timeline": "Immediate cessation to 6 months, depending on the complexity of discontinuing the activity and its dependencies.",
                "approval_required": "The Risk Owner (e.g., CIO/BU Head) is responsible for avoiding the risk. Due to the significant business impact, this decision would typically require approval from senior executive management or the relevant steering committee.",
                "monitoring_required": "Monitoring for any residual impacts from the ceased activity, ensuring all related data and processes are securely handled, and assessing for any new risks introduced by alternative approaches or the absence of the original activity."
