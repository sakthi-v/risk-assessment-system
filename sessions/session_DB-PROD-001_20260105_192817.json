This does not eliminate the risk itself but reallocates the responsibility for managing or bearing the consequences of the risk. It often involves premiums or service fees.",

                "consequences": "Transferring the risk can reduce the organization's direct financial exposure and operational burden. However, it introduces dependency on the third party and requires careful contract management to ensure the risk is adequately covered.

This is the most drastic form of treatment, as it removes the risk source entirely. It is typically considered when the risk is unacceptably high, and no other treatment option can reduce it to an acceptable level, or the cost of other treatments is prohibitive.",
                "recommendation": "This option is generally reserved for non-acceptable risks (rating > 2) where the activity itself is deemed too dangerous or costly to continue. For DB-PROD-001, terminating the risk would mean decommissioning the database or ceasing the operations that rely on it. This is usually a last resort and would only be considered if the database's function is not critical or can be replaced without incurring new, equally severe risks.",
                "consequences": "Choosing to terminate the risk will completely remove the threat exposure associated with DB-PROD-001. However, it will also mean the cessation of the business functions or services that rely on this database, potentially leading to significant operational disruption, loss of revenue, or the need to find alternative, potentially costly, solutions. This option has significant business impact and requires careful strategic consideration.",
