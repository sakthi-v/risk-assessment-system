                "label": "Treat the Risk (Implement Controls)",
                "description": "Treating the risk involves implementing new or enhanced controls to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk to an acceptable level. This strategy aims to actively modify the risk by addressing its root causes and vulnerabilities. The objective is to bring the residual risk evaluation rating down to an acceptable level (1 or 2) through proactive measures.",
                "recommendation": "This option is highly recommended when the residual risk is 'Non-Acceptable' (rating > 2), as is the case here (2.56/5). It is appropriate when effective controls can be identified and implemented to significantly reduce the risk, and when the benefits of implementing these controls outweigh their costs. This strategy directly addresses the identified control gaps.",
                "consequences": "Choosing to TREAT means investing resources (time, money, personnel) into implementing the recommended controls. If successful, the residual risk will be reduced, enhancing the security posture of corporate laptops and protecting sensitive data. Failure to implement effectively could lead to continued exposure and wasted resources, requiring re-evaluation.",
                "estimated_cost": "Varies significantly based on control complexity and scale; typically involves procurement, implementation, and operational costs for new security solutions. A preliminary estimate for the recommended controls would be required.",
                "typical_timeline": "Short-term to Medium-term (e.g., 1-6 months for implementation of all recommended controls, followed by ongoing management).",
                "approval_required": "The Risk Owner (CIO/L1 Head for Corporate Security) is responsible for reviewing and approving the Risk Treatment Plan, which details the controls to be implemented.",
                "monitoring_required": "Ongoing monitoring of the implemented controls' effectiveness, regular review of the residual risk, and continuous vulnerability management are required to ensure the risk remains at an acceptable level."

                "label": "Accept the Risk",
                "description": "Risk acceptance is an informed decision to take a particular risk without implementing further controls to reduce it. This means acknowledging the potential consequences and deciding that the cost or effort of further treatment outweighs the benefits, or that the risk falls within the organization's acceptable risk appetite. Accepted risks are subject to monitoring and review.",
                "recommendation": "This option is generally appropriate for risks with an 'Acceptable Risk Evaluation Rating' (1 or 2). For 'Non-Acceptable Risks' (rating > 2), like the current 2.56/5, acceptance is only considered if implementing controls is not feasible due to significant financial, administrative, or technical reasons, and after a thorough cost-benefit analysis. It is not recommended for high-severity, easily mitigable risks.",
                "consequences": "Accepting the current 'Non-Acceptable' risk means the organization will continue to operate with a high level of exposure to security threats on corporate laptops. This could lead to potential data breaches, regulatory non-compliance, reputational damage, and financial losses if a security incident occurs. While it avoids immediate treatment costs, it carries the risk of higher future costs from incidents.",
                "estimated_cost": "No direct implementation cost, but carries the potential for significant indirect costs from security incidents (e.g., data breach response, legal fees, fines, reputational damage).",
                "typical_timeline": "Immediate decision, with ongoing monitoring and periodic review (e.g., annually) of the accepted risk.",
                "approval_required": "The Risk Owner (CIO/L1 Head for Corporate Security) must accept the risk. If the risk evaluation rating is above 2 (as it is here), the accepted risk must also be approved by a Risk Approver (e.g., RCAC or Delivery Compliance Officer - Lead). If the risk affects an engagement, customer approval may also be required.",
                "monitoring_required": "Accepted risks are subject to monitoring and periodic review (e.g., annually) to ensure the risk context has not changed and the decision to accept remains valid. This includes tracking any incidents related to the accepted risk."

                "label": "Transfer the Risk",
                "description": "Risk transfer involves shifting the financial or operational impact of a risk to a third party. This is typically done through mechanisms like insurance, outsourcing to a managed service provider, or contractual agreements with vendors. It's important to note that while the impact may be transferred, the ultimate accountability for the risk often remains with the organization.",
                "recommendation": "This option is suitable for certain 'Non-Acceptable Risks' (rating > 2) where a third party is better equipped to manage the risk, or where the cost of transfer (e.g., insurance premiums) is less than the potential cost of the risk event and internal treatment. A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis and due diligence on the third party are mandatory. For corporate laptop security, this might involve cyber insurance or outsourcing endpoint management.",
                "consequences": "Transferring the risk can reduce the direct financial burden and operational responsibility for managing specific aspects of the risk. However, it introduces reliance on a third party, requiring careful contract management and oversight. The organization retains accountability and may still suffer reputational damage or indirect costs even if the direct financial impact is covered. Risk is never fully transferred.",
                "estimated_cost": "Varies widely depending on the transfer mechanism (e.g., insurance premiums, managed service fees, contractual costs). A cost-benefit analysis is required to determine feasibility.",
                "typical_timeline": "Medium-term (e.g., 3-9 months) for identifying a suitable third party, negotiating contracts, and implementing the transfer mechanism.",
                "approval_required": "The Risk Owner (CIO/L1 Head for Corporate Security) is responsible for performing the cost-benefit analysis and deciding to transfer the risk. The contractual agreement with the third party would undergo standard legal and procurement approval processes.",
                "monitoring_required": "Regular review of the transfer agreement (e.g., quarterly or annually), monitoring of the third party's performance, and assessment of any residual risks that remain with the organization are required."

                "description": "Terminating the risk, also known as risk avoidance, involves making a decision not to become involved in, or to withdraw from, the activity that gives rise to the risk. This eliminates the risk entirely by ceasing the operation or process that creates the exposure. It is the most drastic form of risk treatment.",
                "recommendation": "This option is typically considered for 'Non-Acceptable Risks' (rating > 2) when the risk is extremely high, the potential impact is catastrophic, and no other treatment option (TREAT, ACCEPT, TRANSFER) is feasible or cost-effective. It is only viable if the activity generating the risk is not critical to the organization's core mission or can be replaced by a less risky alternative.",
                "consequences": "Choosing to TERMINATE the risk means ceasing the use of Dell laptops or the specific activities that expose them to these security threats. This would eliminate the risk but could lead to significant operational disruption, loss of business capability, or the need for costly alternative solutions. The impact on business operations must be carefully weighed against the benefits of risk elimination.",
                "estimated_cost": "Can range from minimal (if the activity is non-essential) to very high (if it requires replacing critical infrastructure or processes). Includes potential loss of productivity, revenue, or investment in alternative solutions.",
                "typical_timeline": "Short-term to Medium-term (e.g., 1-6 months) depending on the complexity of ceasing the activity and transitioning to alternatives.",
                "approval_required": "The Risk Owner (CIO/L1 Head for Corporate Security) is responsible for deciding to avoid the non-acceptable risk. This decision would likely require executive-level approval due to its potential impact on business operations.",
                "monitoring_required": "While the specific risk is eliminated, ongoing monitoring of the overall risk landscape is necessary to ensure that new, related risks are not introduced by the alternative activities or solutions adopted."
