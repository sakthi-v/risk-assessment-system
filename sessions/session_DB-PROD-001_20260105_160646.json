                "label": "Treat the Risk (Implement Controls)",
                "description": "Treating the risk involves implementing new or enhanced controls to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk event. This option aims to bring the residual risk down to an acceptable level (typically a rating of 1 or 2) by actively managing the vulnerabilities and threats. It requires a commitment to allocate resources for control implementation and ongoing maintenance.",
                "recommendation": "This option is highly recommended for DB-PROD-001, especially given the identified critical control gaps (e.g., data encryption, DR plan) and the high residual risk. It is appropriate when the organization has the capability and resources to implement effective controls and desires to actively reduce its exposure to the identified threats.",
                "consequences": "Choosing to treat the risk will lead to a stronger security posture for DB-PROD-001, reducing the likelihood of data breaches and improving resilience. It involves upfront investment in resources (time, money, personnel) but mitigates potential future losses from risk realization. Failure to implement effectively could result in continued high risk.",

                "label": "Accept the Risk",
                "description": "Risk acceptance is an informed decision to take a particular risk without implementing further controls to reduce it. This is typically chosen when the risk is already at an acceptable level (rating 1 or 2), or when the cost of treatment outweighs the potential impact of the risk, or when treatment is not feasible. It requires formal acknowledgment and approval from relevant stakeholders.",
                "recommendation": "Accepting the current residual risk of 1.58/5 for DB-PROD-001 is generally not recommended as it is above the organization's acceptable threshold (1-2). This option should only be considered if implementing the recommended controls is demonstrably not feasible due to severe financial, administrative, or technical constraints, and the organization is prepared to bear the full consequences if the risk materializes.",
                "consequences": "Accepting the risk means the organization is willing to bear the potential consequences (e.g., data breach, system outage, regulatory fines) if the security threats to DB-PROD-001 materialize. While it avoids immediate treatment costs, it exposes the organization to potentially much higher costs and reputational damage in the long run. The risk will remain at its current high level.",

                "approval_required": "Risk Owner (CIO/L1 Head) must decide to accept. Risk Approver (RCAC for infrastructure/application impact) must formally approve the acceptance, especially since the risk is above the acceptable threshold.",
                "monitoring_required": "Regular monitoring of the accepted risk to ensure its impact and likelihood do not increase, and to confirm the initial acceptance rationale remains valid. Periodic review of the risk acceptance decision."

                "label": "Transfer the Risk",
                "description": "Risk transfer involves sharing the burden of potential loss with another party, typically through contractual agreements such as insurance policies, outsourcing, or service level agreements. This option does not eliminate the risk but shifts the financial or operational responsibility to a third party. It requires careful negotiation and clear definition of responsibilities.",
                "recommendation": "This option could be considered for DB-PROD-001 to mitigate specific financial impacts, such as data breach insurance or leveraging a cloud provider with strong security SLAs. It is most appropriate for risks where a third party is better equipped to manage or absorb the financial consequences, or where the risk is inherent to a service provided by an external vendor.",
                "consequences": "Transferring the risk can reduce the organization's direct financial exposure to certain risk events. However, it does not absolve the organization of all responsibility (e.g., reputational damage, regulatory compliance). There will be ongoing costs (premiums, service fees), and the effectiveness depends heavily on the terms of the transfer agreement. Residual risks may still remain.",

                "description": "Risk termination, or avoidance, involves eliminating the activity or objective that gives rise to the risk. This is the most drastic option, as it means ceasing operations or discontinuing the use of an asset that presents an unacceptable level of risk. It is chosen when the risk is too high to treat or accept, and its presence outweighs the benefits of the activity.",
                "recommendation": "Terminating the risk for DB-PROD-001 would mean decommissioning the database server or discontinuing the business function it supports. This is generally only recommended if the asset or its function is deemed non-essential, or if the risk is so catastrophic and untreatable that its continued operation poses an existential threat to the organization. Given the 'PROD' designation, this is likely a critical asset.",
                "consequences": "Choosing to terminate the risk would eliminate the specific threats associated with DB-PROD-001, but it would also result in the loss of the business functionality or data provided by this critical asset. This could lead to significant operational disruption, loss of revenue, or the need to find costly alternative solutions. It is a high-impact decision.",
