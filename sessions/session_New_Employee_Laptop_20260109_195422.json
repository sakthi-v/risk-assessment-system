                "label": "Treat the Risk (Implement Controls)",
                "description": "Treating the risk involves taking actions to lessen the probability, negative consequences, or both, associated with the identified risk. This typically means implementing new controls or enhancing existing ones to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. The goal is to proactively mitigate vulnerabilities and strengthen the organization's security posture.",
                "recommendation": "This option is recommended when the risk evaluation rating is above 2, and effective controls can be implemented to reduce the risk to an acceptable level (1 or 2). It is particularly appropriate when a clear, high-severity control gap exists, and a feasible solution (like automated patching) is available to directly address it.",
                "consequences": "Choosing to treat the risk will lead to improved security posture, reduced likelihood of security incidents, and better protection of organizational assets and data. It requires resource allocation for implementation and ongoing management of the new controls. Failure to implement effectively could result in continued exposure.",
                "estimated_cost": "Medium (e.g., $50-$200 per laptop annually for tooling/management, plus initial setup costs for the recommended patching solution).",

                "approval_required": "Risk Owner (CIO / L1 Head for Infrastructure/Corporate Security) must review and approve the Risk Treatment Plan.",

                "label": "Accept the Risk",
                "description": "Accepting the risk is an informed decision to take on the burden of potential loss associated with a risk, without implementing further controls to reduce it. This decision is typically made when the risk is already at an acceptable level (rating 1 or 2), or when the cost or impracticality of further treatment outweighs the potential benefits. Accepted risks are subject to ongoing monitoring and review.",
                "recommendation": "This option is appropriate if the residual risk (currently 1.11/5) is deemed acceptable by management, or if the cost-benefit analysis shows that implementing the recommended patching control is not feasible due to financial, administrative, or technical reasons. Given the 'HIGH' severity of the patch management gap, formal acceptance requires strong justification.",
                "consequences": "If accepted, the organization will bear the full potential impact of the 'Missing Regular Patch Management' gap, including increased vulnerability to exploits, potential system compromise, data breaches, or service disruption. While no immediate costs for new controls are incurred, the potential future costs from an incident could be significantly higher. Accepted risks require periodic review.",
                "estimated_cost": "Low immediate cost (no new controls implemented), but potentially High future cost if the risk materializes (e.g., incident response, data recovery, reputational damage).",
                "typical_timeline": "Immediate decision, with ongoing monitoring and review typically on a quarterly or annual basis.",
                "approval_required": "Risk Owner (CIO / L1 Head) must accept the risk. For non-acceptable risks (rating > 2, or high severity gap), the Risk Approver (RCAC) must also approve the acceptance.",
                "monitoring_required": "Periodic review of the accepted risk (e.g., using a Risk Acceptance Tracker) to ensure its status and impact remain within acceptable parameters. This includes monitoring for new threats that might increase the risk level."

                "label": "Transfer the Risk",
                "description": "Transferring the risk involves sharing with another party the burden of loss or benefit of gain for a risk. This shifts the financial or operational impact to a third party, such as an insurer, vendor, or contractor, through mechanisms like insurance policies, outsourcing agreements, or service level agreements (SLAs). It's important to note that accountability for the risk generally remains with the organization.",
                "recommendation": "This option could be considered if the organization wishes to offload the financial or operational burden of managing patch management to a specialized third-party service provider or through a cyber insurance policy. It is typically suitable for risks with a residual risk value above 2, where external expertise or financial protection is a viable and cost-effective solution.",
                "consequences": "Transferring the risk can reduce the direct financial exposure and operational burden on the organization. However, it introduces vendor management overhead, requires careful contractual agreements, and does not eliminate the risk entirely (accountability remains). There will be costs associated with the transfer mechanism (e.g., insurance premiums, service fees).",
                "estimated_cost": "Medium-High (e.g., annual premiums for cyber insurance covering patching failures, or monthly fees for managed IT services that include patch management).",

                "approval_required": "Risk Owner (CIO / L1 Head) is responsible for transferring non-acceptable risks. A cost-benefit analysis is required prior to this decision.",

                "description": "Terminating the risk, also known as risk avoidance, involves making a decision not to become involved in, or taking action to withdraw from, the activity that gives rise to the risk. This eliminates the risk entirely by ceasing the activity or objective that presents the threat. It is the most drastic form of risk treatment.",
                "recommendation": "This option is generally considered for risks with a high evaluation rating (above 2) where the activity itself is deemed too risky to continue, and other treatment options are either ineffective or too costly. For 'Security threats to Employee Laptop', this would imply ceasing the use of employee laptops or the specific activity that creates the patch management vulnerability.",
                "consequences": "Choosing to terminate the risk would eliminate the 'Security threats to Employee Laptop' risk by, for example, discontinuing the use of employee laptops or specific applications that require patching. This would have significant operational impacts, potentially hindering productivity and business functions. While the specific risk is removed, new operational challenges or risks might emerge.",
                "estimated_cost": "Potentially High (e.g., costs associated with replacing laptops with alternative devices, loss of productivity, re-engineering business processes).",
                "typical_timeline": "Medium-Long term (6-12+ months for phasing out laptops or re-architecting IT infrastructure and business processes).",
                "approval_required": "Risk Owner (CIO / L1 Head) is responsible for avoiding non-acceptable risks. This decision would likely require executive-level approval due to its significant operational impact.",
                "monitoring_required": "Monitoring to ensure the activity giving rise to the risk has indeed ceased and that no new, unforeseen risks have been introduced by the avoidance strategy."
