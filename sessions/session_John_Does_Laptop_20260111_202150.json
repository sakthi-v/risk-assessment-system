This strategy aims to modify the risk by lowering its probability or negative consequences, bringing the risk evaluation rating down to an acceptable level (typically 1 or 2). It requires identifying, implementing, and continuously monitoring the effectiveness of preventive, detective, and corrective measures. This is the recommended approach for risks with a high initial rating.",

Accepted risks are subject to ongoing monitoring and periodic review.",
            "recommendation": "This option is generally NOT recommended for a risk with a rating of 5/5 and 5.0/5 residual risk, as it falls significantly outside the organization's acceptable risk criteria (1 or 2).

However, it does not eliminate the operational risk or the need for basic preventative controls. It is not a substitute for treating a high-rated risk, but rather a way to mitigate financial exposure. A thorough cost-benefit analysis of insurance premiums versus potential losses is essential.",
            "consequences": "Transferring the risk, typically through cyber insurance, can provide financial compensation for losses incurred due to a ransomware/malware attack, such as recovery costs, business interruption, and legal fees.

While it would eliminate the risk associated with this specific asset, it is generally not a practical solution for essential corporate assets like laptops. It should only be considered if the laptop is non-essential, severely compromised beyond repair, or if its continued use poses an unacceptable and untreatable risk to the wider organization.",
            "consequences": "If John Doe's laptop is terminated, the risk of ransomware/malware attack and system compromise on that specific asset is eliminated. However, this would result in the loss of the asset's functionality and John Doe's ability to perform work requiring the laptop. This could lead to productivity loss, potential data loss if not backed up, and the need to procure and configure a replacement asset, incurring new costs and operational delays.",

This is the most drastic risk treatment option and is typically chosen when the risk is unacceptably high, cannot be effectively treated or transferred, and the benefits of the activity do not outweigh the potential harm. It effectively removes the risk source, but it also means foregoing the benefits associated with the activity or asset. A thorough justification and impact analysis are required before pursuing this option.",
            "recommendation": "This option would involve decommissioning John Doe's laptop or ceasing the activities that expose it to malware, which is generally not practical for an essential business asset. It is only recommended if the laptop's function is non-critical, the risk of data loss is catastrophic and untreatable, and the cost of maintaining the asset or the risk it poses far outweighs its utility. Given that a clear treatment option (EDR/Antivirus) exists, terminating the asset is likely an overreaction and would incur significant productivity loss.",
            "consequences": "Terminating the risk by decommissioning John Doe's laptop would eliminate the threat of data loss or corruption from malware on that specific device. However, it would also result in the loss of productivity for John Doe, potential costs for replacing the asset or finding alternative means to perform the work, and potential data migration challenges. This option should only be considered as a last resort when all other treatment strategies are infeasible or insufficient for a critical risk.",

            "approval_required": "Management Approval (e.g., Risk Committee, CRO, Business Head) and potentially Board approval for critical risks, as this involves ceasing an operational activity or asset.",
            "monitoring_required": "No ongoing monitoring for the terminated risk itself, as the source is removed. However, monitoring would be required for any new processes or assets introduced to replace the terminated activity to ensure new risks are not introduced."
