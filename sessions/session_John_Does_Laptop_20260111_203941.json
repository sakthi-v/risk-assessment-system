It is the most appropriate strategy for risks with a risk evaluation rating above 2.",

It is appropriate when the cost of transferring the risk (e.g., insurance premiums) is less than the potential cost of a breach, or when specialized third-party expertise is needed for mitigation and response. It does not eliminate the need for some internal controls but can provide a safety net.",
