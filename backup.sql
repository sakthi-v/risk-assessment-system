It is not identified as \"CIA\" or \"DREAD\".\n\nThe methodology quantifies risk impact as a numerical quantity on a relative scale, independent of probability, with specific definitions for each category. This impact value is then used in conjunction with risk probability to derive an overall risk value. While the concept of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) is considered when developing the consequence criteria for impact, it is part of the custom framework rather than being the name of the methodology itself.\n\nHere are the details from the provided documents:\n\n**1. Identification and Quantification of Risk Impact:**\n\n*   **Process Step:** The Risk Management Procedure includes a task to \"Identify risk impact (consequences) if vulnerability is exploited.\"\n    *   **Document:** `Risk Management SOP_For RM Agentic AI Use Case v1.0.docx`, Table 3, \"Risk Assessment\" section.\n*   **Definition:** \"Impact shall be quantified as a numerical quantity to reflect damage if a given threat successfully exploits an associated vulnerability. Risk impact value rates the seriousness of a given risk on a relative scale, independent of its probability.\"\n    *   **Document:** `Risk Management Guidelines_For RM Agentic AI Use Case v1.0.docx`, Section 4.4.5 \"Identify the Risk Impact\".\n*   **Scale for Estimation:** The organization uses the following scale to estimate Risk Impact:\n    *   **Document:** `Risk Management Guidelines_For RM Agentic AI Use Case v1.0.docx`, Section 4.5.2 \"Risk Impact Evaluation (Compute the ’RI Value’)\" and Table 4.\n\n    **TABLE: Risk Impact Evaluation Scale**\n    ────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼──────────────\n    Impact Category | Impact Definition                                                | Impact Rating\n    ────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼──────────────\n    Very Low        | Risk has negligible impact on business and operations            | 1            \n    Low             | Risk does not have significant impact on business and operations | 2            \n    Medium          | Risk has minimum impact on business and operations               | 3            \n    High            | Risk has serious impact on business and operations               | 4            \n    Very High       | Risk has catastrophic impact on business and operations          | 5            \n    ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n**2. Considerations for Consequence (Impact) Criteria:**\n\nWhen defining consequence criteria (which informs the impact assessment), the organization considers the \"extent of damage or loss, or harm to an organization or individual resulting from the loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information.\"\nFactors explicitly considered for consequence criteria include:\n*   Loss of life or harm to individuals or groups\n*   Loss of freedom, dignity or right to privacy\n*   Loss of staff and intellectual capital (skills and expertise)\n*   Impaired internal or third-party operations (e.g., damage to a business function or process)\n*   Effects to plans and deadlines\n*   Loss of business and financial value\n*   Loss of business advantage or market share\n*   Damage to public trust or reputation\n*   Breaches of legal, regulatory or statutory requirements\n*   Breaches of contracts or service levels\n*   Adverse impact on interested parties\n*   Negative impact on the environment, pollution\n\nThe organization determines \"how many categories of consequences are used, how they are defined, and what consequences are associated with each category,\" which can vary depending on the organization’s internal and external context. Monetary consequence scales are mentioned as an example, often expressed in a logarithmic scale.\n*   **Document:** `Risk Management Guidelines_For RM Agentic AI Use Case v1.0.docx`, Section 6.4.3.2 \"Consequence criteria\".\n\n**3. Integration into Risk Value Calculation:**\n\nThe identified risk impact (RI Value) is a critical component in computing the overall \"Risk Value\" (RV). The process indicates that once vulnerabilities, threats, and likelihood (probability) are identified, the risk value is computed.\n*   **Document:** `Risk Management Guidelines_For RM Agentic AI Use Case v1.0.docx`, Section 4.5.1 \"Risk Evaluation (Compute the ’Risk Value’)\" states: \"Once the vulnerabilities, threats and likelihood are identified, the risk value (RV) will be computed for each vulnerability / threat pair to the asset under consideration. The following model will be applied for computing the Risk Value: [model not explicitly detailed in the text but implied by the overall framework].\"\n*   **Document:** `Risk Management SOP_For RM Agentic AI Use Case v1.0.docx`, Table 3, under \"Risk Assessment\" tasks: \"Identify risk impact (consequences) if vulnerability is exploited\", \"Identify risk probability\", and \"Determine risk value\".\n\nIn summary, the organization uses a **custom, scaled approach** to assess impact, which is categorized from \"Very Low\" to \"Very High\" with corresponding numerical ratings from 1 to 5. This impact rating, alongside probability, feeds into a broader calculation to determine the overall risk value."','2026-02-02 03:24:42','2026-02-02 03:26:26',1);

Agentic AI RM Use Case.xlsx, Sheet: Asset Inventorization Guideline; Asset Management Guidelines_For RM Agentic AI Use Case v1.0.docx, Table 3 (for Business Impact Rating Definitions) and implicit reference to the chart*\n\n**Explanation of the Matrix:**\n\n1.  First, the business impact on the organization due to the loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability for the asset is rated individually using the categories: Insignificant, Moderate, Serious, and Extreme.\n2.  To find the \"Asset Business Value\" using the matrix:\n    *   Locate the **Integrity** rating in the \"Integrity\" row header (leftmost column).\n    *   Locate the **Confidentiality** rating in the \"Confidentiality\" row header.\n    *   Locate the **Availability** rating in the \"Availability\" column header (top row, under Confidentiality).\n    *   The intersection of these three ratings in the chart provides the **Asset Business Value**.\n\n**Example (from the document):**\n\"For example: If the Ratings for a particular asset have been determined as: Confidentiality-Moderate, Availability-Moderate, Integrity-Serious, then the Asset Business Value is \"High\".\"\n*(Note: The example in the document''s Excel file uses \"Low\" instead of \"Moderate\" for Confidentiality and Availability, but \"Low\" is not an allowed input rating. The provided matrix only uses Insignificant, Moderate, Serious, Extreme. Therefore, the example has been adjusted here to match the matrix''s input categories and its corresponding output.)*\n\n**Formula for Automated Derivation:**\n\nIn the `Asset Inventory` sheet of `Risk Assessment Template_For Agentic AI RM Use Case.xlsx`, the Asset Business Value is automatically derived using a `VLOOKUP` formula. The formula concatenates the individual C, I, and A impact ratings to form a lookup key and then finds the corresponding Asset Business Value from a predefined lookup table (matrix).\n\nFor example, in `Asset Inventory` sheet, Cell `I7` (Asset business value) contains the formula:\n`=VLOOKUP(F7&G7&H7, $Y$139:$Z$202, 2, 0)`\n\n*   `F7` represents the \"Business Impact - due to loss of Confidentiality\".\n*   `G7` represents the \"Business Impact - due to loss of Integrity\".\n*   `H7` represents the \"Business Impact - due to loss of Availability\".\n*   `$Y$139:$Z$202` is the lookup table (matrix) where column `Y` contains the concatenated CIA impact ratings (e.g., \"InsignificantSeriousSerious\") and column `Z` contains the corresponding \"Asset Business Value\".\n*   `2` indicates that the second column of the lookup range (`$Z$139:$Z$202`) should be returned.\n*   `0` (or FALSE) specifies an exact match.\n\nThis confirms that a matrix (lookup table) is used, and a formula (`VLOOKUP`) automates this lookup in the Excel template.\n\n**2. Asset Business Value Levels:**\n\nThe determined Asset Business Value falls into one of the following five levels:\n\n*   **Very Low**\n*   **Low**\n*   **Medium**\n*   **High**\n*   **Very High**\n\nThese Asset Business Value levels are then used to classify assets for criticality.\n\n**Asset Business Value and Corresponding Criticality Classification:**\n\n─────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nAsset Business Value | Asset Criticality Classification | Description                                                        \n─────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nVery Low             | Insignificant                    | Very low impact on business if C,I and A of asset gets compromised \nLow                  | Low Critical                     | Low impact on business if C,I and A of asset gets compromised      \nMedium               | Medium Critical                  | Medium impact on business if C,I and A of asset gets compromised   \nHigh                 | High Critical                    | High impact on business if C,I and A of asset gets compromised     \nVery high            | Very high Critical               | Very high impact on business if C,I and A of asset gets compromised\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n*Source: Asset Management Guidelines_For RM Agentic AI Use Case v1.0.docx, Table 4; Risk Assessment Template_For Agentic AI RM Use Case.xlsx, Sheet: Asset Inventorization Guideline*"','2026-02-02 03:27:20','2026-02-02 03:27:20',0);

While the impact may be shared, it is critical to understand that accountability for the risk always remains with the organization. This is typically achieved through contractual agreements or insurance policies.", "recommendation": "This option is suitable for ''Non-Acceptable'' risks (rating > 2) where the impact can be financially or operationally offloaded to a third party. For ERP security threats, this could involve cyber insurance, outsourcing specific security functions to a managed security service provider (MSSP), or robust contractual agreements with the ERP vendor (Microsoft Dynamics 365) for shared responsibilities.", "consequences": "Transferring the risk can reduce the direct financial burden of an incident but does not eliminate the risk entirely. The organization retains accountability and may still suffer reputational damage or operational disruption. It involves costs for premiums or service fees, and careful due diligence is required to ensure the third party can effectively manage their portion of the risk. Residual risks after transfer must still be assessed and managed.", "estimated_cost": "Costs can vary widely: Cyber insurance premiums typically range from $10,000 - $100,000+ annually. Outsourcing security functions could cost $5,000 - $50,000+ monthly, depending on scope.", "typical_timeline": "Implementation of transfer mechanisms (e.g., securing insurance, negotiating contracts) can take 1-6 months.

For ''Security threats to ERP Application'' on Microsoft Dynamics 365, this would imply discontinuing the use of Microsoft Dynamics 365 or the specific functionality causing the risk, which is likely not a viable option for a core ERP system.", "consequences": "Choosing to terminate the risk by ceasing the activity will eliminate the specific risk but will also result in the loss of the associated business function or capability. This can lead to significant operational disruption, loss of business value, and potentially require investment in alternative solutions. It may also incur sunk costs from previous investments in the terminated activity.", "estimated_cost": "Costs are primarily opportunity costs and potential re-platforming costs.

For ''Security threats to Employee Laptop'', this would imply ceasing the use of employee laptops or the specific activity that creates the patch management vulnerability.", "consequences": "Choosing to terminate the risk would eliminate the ''Security threats to Employee Laptop'' risk by, for example, discontinuing the use of employee laptops or specific applications that require patching. This would have significant operational impacts, potentially hindering productivity and business functions. While the specific risk is removed, new operational challenges or risks might emerge.", "estimated_cost": "Potentially High (e.g., costs associated with replacing laptops with alternative devices, loss of productivity, re-engineering business processes).", "typical_timeline": "Medium-Long term (6-12+ months for phasing out laptops or re-architecting IT infrastructure and business processes).", "approval_required": "Risk Owner (CIO / L1 Head) is responsible for avoiding non-acceptable risks. This decision would likely require executive-level approval due to its significant operational impact.", "monitoring_required": "Monitoring to ensure the activity giving rise to the risk has indeed ceased and that no new, unforeseen risks have been introduced by the avoidance strategy."}]}]}]}, "agent_5_result": null, "last_updated": "2026-01-09 20:59:49", "progress": {"agent_1": "complete", "agent_2": "complete", "agent_3": "complete", "agent_4": "complete", "agent_5": "pending"}}','2026-02-03 19:29:41','2026-02-03 19:29:41');
